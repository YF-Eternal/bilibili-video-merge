I just casually wrote a little gadget in **Python** to help.

## Start
### 1. Install
* Requires version **[Python3.9](https://python.org/downloads/)** or higher to run.
* Install **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages)** and configure environment variables。
* Unzip"**bilibili-video-merge.zip**"

### 2. Finish
#### Use the downloader to download the two files, which are M4A/M4S and MP4.
* Copy M4A/M4S and MP4 to the software root directory and run the software directly (double-click to run).
> If it is **M4A**, run "**m4a&mp4.py**".  
> If it is **M4S**, run "**m4s&mp4.py**".
#### After running, the merged MP4 file After merge - xxx.mp4) will be generated in the root directory of the software.
